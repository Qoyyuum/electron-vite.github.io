During the use process, you may also need to learn some knowledge.

## Electron

It is the core and we need to use it to create desktop clients. So you need to understand its function.

## Vite

It is one of the tools used to build pages. It's inevitable for me.
If you want to implement some functions on the page, such as optimizing page size, using atomic CSS, etc., you need to understand vite and use it to load some plugins.
